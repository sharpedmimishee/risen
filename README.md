# ðŸŒ… Risen License generator
![Console Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mimisheesharp/risen/images/risen.png "console image")

I made this because it was a hassle to have to open a browser every time to create a license file.  
Risen currently only supports the MIT license.

## How to Install the Risen
1. Clone this repository  
`git clone https://github.com/mimisheesharp/risen`
2. Build the Risen  
`cargo build`

For Windows, try adding the directory containing rise.exe to the Path environment variable.  
If you're using Linux, you know how to do this, right?

If you want to generate a license:
`risen license`
